**🚀 My Current Project: AI-Powered Nutrition Guide**

I am currently developing a mobile application designed to promote healthier eating habits. This app, built with **Flutter**, empowers users to make informed dietary choices instantly.

-   **Core Feature:** It uses a **Multimodal LLM** to scan and analyze food packaging photos.
-   **Functionality:** It extracts ingredient lists and nutritional data to provide personalized health advice, especially for users with conditions like hypertension or diabetes.
-   **Tech:** The frontend is built with Flutter, communicating with a robust backend system.
